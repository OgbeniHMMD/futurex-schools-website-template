# schools-website-template

This is a basic template for school that have adopted FutureX.

## Theme setup

You can tweak the color scheme in the `/tailwind.config.js` file. E.g:

```
extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: '#066d36',
        secondary: '#A6EBC9',
        accent: '#fffbdb',
      },
    },
```

##

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
